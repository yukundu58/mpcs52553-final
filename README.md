## Reservation System of Uchicago Libraries

There are several libraries in University of Chicago and besides the public study zone, each library has its own group study or self-study rooms that we could book in advance.
So I want to build a room-book system for the teacher, staff and students in Uchicago.

There are three models: Library, User and Reservation.

We also have a sign-in system and support two kinds of users: Administrator and non-administrator. The administrators could change add new libraries, edit the number of available rooms of each library and limit the right of book right for a specific user. The non-administrator could make reservation for the room of specific library.
